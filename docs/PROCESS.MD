1. **What Did you Build** I built a shopping bag feature that allows users to add menu items to their bag. It allows them to increment and decrement the quantity, remove items entirely, and calculates how much each item is costing as well as the subtotal for everything in their bag.
2. **How did micro-iteration feel** Working in micro-iteration made the process feel slower. I understand the purpose behind it, though. It can be useful when you want to understand code more in-depth and debug easier. It takes up a lot more time though and can confuse the user temporarily as there are many placeholders before features are officially functional.
3. **What did self-review catch?** It found lots of issues. Sometimes it was minor like consistency edits or stylistic edits. Sometimes the AI had made up rules that don't exist. For example, pointer-events: 'all' doesn't exist, but the AI generated it for me and then corrected itself to pointer-events: 'auto'. It noticed things that might be an issue if the project expands, but could work for the current level. 
4. **Tool Impressions** I liked that Claude Web comes with its own code editor where you can copy the code from. I disliked that I had to keep sharing it my code by copying and pasting. 
5. **Self-Review Patterns** There was an error I caught myself that the AI missed. The button to close the shopping bag, was above the viewport so it was out-of-frame. The AI didn't notice that bug until I brought it up, and then it was able to suggest fixes. The AI would correct an issue, like the 'pointer-events: all' rule, but then make the same mistake when adding new code to the file. Then when I asked it to review its own code, it mentioned that the error had snuck back in. This points to AI's limited working memory at times.
6. **Browser Tool vs CLI comparison** I prefer the Claude Code CLI / VS Code extension much better than Claude on the web. It can read my whole file structure and suggest changes that work straight-away. Using Claude on the web meant that I had to copy and paste the files I was working on. My project is bigger than that so there was a lot of missing context for the AI when using Claude Code on the web. One thing Claude Code on the web does is it allows you to preview the code on the web before integrating it. This can lead to a more intimate knowledge of the code. Claude Code CLI is very quick with edits, and it is far too easy to implement them without truly reviewing and understanding what they do. 
7. **When would you use Micro-Iteration + Self-Review** I would use Micro-Iteration when learning how to build new features. It allows for a deeper learning experience and slows the AI down. This lets me review more code and understand what each line is doing. Sometimes with traditional prompting, the AI generates way too fast and users don't end up studying the code they are integrating. After doing this assignment, I understand how important it is to have the AI self-review its output. The AI makes mistakes too and without self-review, many of these mistakes go unnoticed. Even if you're going to use big prompts, self-review is essential to catch bugs early on. 

I would skip this workflow when time is of the essence or I am writing something basic or a feature I am extremely familar with. Micro-iteration slows developers down quite a bit. Additionally, if I am building a feature I have built many times in the past, it is easier for me to offload it to the AI and review its work. I already know how the feature should work and how it should be implemented. Self-review still seems important and should be used as much as possible to minimize pushing potential bugs to the codebase.
